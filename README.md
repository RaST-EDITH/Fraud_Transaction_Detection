# Fraud Detection

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This Python-based project focuses on analyzing financial data to detect fraudulent activities. It encompasses data collection, preprocessing for cleaning and feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns indicative of fraud. Machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Gradient Boosting are trained and evaluated using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score. The selected model is deployed for real-time analysis, integrated into existing systems, and continuously monitored for performance. The project aims to enhance security by identifying and preventing fraudulent transactions, thereby safeguarding financial integrity.
